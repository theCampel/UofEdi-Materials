Exercise 1:
Several could be the odd one out. Initially I believed B as it had no border around it. Then I believed D as it was the only Blue one. Then I thought C was another option as it was the only round object. Alternatively E as it's the only smaller shape.

Exercise 4:
1. > and [isThick n | n <- things, isBlue n]
True
2. > or [isBig n | n <- things, isOrange n]

Exercise 5:
1. It is not the case that some Square is Blue
> not (or [isBlue n | n <- things, isSquare n])
False
2. Every Square is not Blue
> and [not (isBlue n )| n <- things, isSquare n]
False
