# Instruction Misinterpretation #

When the instructions said "merge" the contents for the worksheet,
I interpreted that to mean I should, quite literally, merge them, pasting them one after
another. However, unfortunately this was not what was intended by the course organisers.
With little time to update it, I must therefore acknowledge this mishap in the reflections.

# Good and useful things #

I'm by far the most proud of the diagram. My first diagram in design01
was the visual result of very little thought and effort into what makes
a good visual description. My tutor (Ray Jiang) even said that
it "wasn't explained well" and took too long to understand (30 seconds).
My new diagram was the result of countless rounds of trial and error (and
pieces of paper), where I experimented with different styles, layouts and formats.
Having settled with a blend of appealing form and practical function, I can't help but
smile when I see a simple diagram with numerous failed and convoluted predecessors.

My Uncle Antonio Romero was by far the most beneficial to me during this process.
He's partially sighted and used to be a developer before he lost his most of his vision.
He helped me learn about the different difficulties that the partially sighted have, as well
as the efforts to help improve the quality of life and in their use of tech. As a past
developer as well, he taught me the pitfalls / struggles there are when you're explaining
to beginners. This was beneficial to me as my project was slowly steering away from
being beginner- and accessible-friendly, two of the essential points this project is clearly
trying to teach.

The biggest thing that went wrong was my time management. I asked my Student Advisor for
help, and they pointed me to numerous resources for time management. I didn't realise just
how time-consuming it was to make a simple diagram, or in simplifying convoluted technical terms to nuanced
yet intuitive explanations. In the future, this will benefit me greatly as
I now have a better idea for the sorts of time demands these requirements have. Also,
it will help me in adjusting my other priorities to allow each personal task the time it requires.

# What you would do differently #

### 1. Remember it's for beginners ###

Throughout the entire assignment, I was slowly introducing more and more technical jargon and methodologies.
I tended to include using multiple methods, calling each other from within themselves. I also originally
included hashmaps. But when it was pointed out to me (by James Serhan - A fellow person in my tutorial)
that it's not beginner-focused enough,
I had to rethink and redesign a large portion of the design. This took a lot of time and would have been
nice to have had as advice from the get-go.

### 2. Accessibility is not an afterthought  ###

The time and effort required for the research for appropriately implementing accessibility-friendly parts
of the writeup (the design diagram description etc.) was far more than I originally thought. If
I had been adding it as I progressed, I would not have had unnecessary stress before the (formative) deadline
trying to go through and make it more friendly. I also would have not felt bad when my partially sighted uncle
read my work.

### 3. The diagram isn't just a quick sketch. ###

In the cohort-level feedback, Prof Brian Mitchell wrote:
> "minimalism takes effort".

I didn't realise how accurate that was until I challenged myself with writing as few words
as was necessary in my diagram. I only did this after I realised how convoluted my original was.
If I were doing this again, I would have set myself that challenge to begin with. I would then
have saved myself time.

# What you have learnt #

### Accessibility is everyone's problem to fix. ### 

Accessibility (and the lack there-of) will affect virtually everyone at some point in their lives.

> director general)

When designing anything, be it a product for consumer use, a website, or literally anything anyone will use,
it's vital to consider everyone's potential accessibility needs. Some may be hard of hearing, partially sighted,
have mobility issues or many many more. This project helped me learn that it requires so little to
design with the less abled in mind, and yet is such a crucial thing for society.

# What effect this has had on you #

I will forever more code and design projects with the idea of accessibility at the forefront of my mind.
This project has taught me that accessibility is everyone's problem to fix, and so it must be considered
when contemplating solutions for any task at hand. Designing systems that can only be used by the able-bodied
isn't only unfair, it doesn't lead to ideas from the entire population. For the rest of my coding degree, I
will follow the simple and easy process of considering for people with abilities more than just my own.
