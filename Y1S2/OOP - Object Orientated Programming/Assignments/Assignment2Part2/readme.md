# Welcome to Assignment&nbsp;2 Part&nbsp;2 ##

This is document version&nbsp;1, dated 2023-02-27.

## An important change since Part&nbsp;1 ##

The original instructions for Part&nbsp;1 said that you had to have
two designs for Part&nbsp;2. This is no longer the case because we
have reduced the workload. You now only submit one design for
Part&nbsp;2. In the vast majority of cases this will be a revision or
evolution of your design from Part&nbsp;1.

If the design from Part&nbsp;1 turned out to be totally unworkable
then you should use a different design. However only abandon your
Part&nbsp;1 design if it is truly unworkable. Stick with your
Part&nbsp;1 design even if you have since thought of a "better"
design. You will write about that as part of the submission.

Changing your design late into an assignment is a common situation
with students. However, it is fraught with danger and should never be
undertaken lightly. You should only change if you are truly in a bad
place with the current design rather than because you are not in the
best place. Generally in life it is preferable to make a good decision
now rather than delay making the "best" decision some time later.

## Notes ##

1. You can personalise the styling of this document for accessibility
   (and fun) by editing the `<STYLE>` section at the end. See
   Tutorial&nbsp;3 for further details. In IntelliJ there should be a
   pane next to this showing the rendered version of this `markdown`
   source. Instructions are in Tutorial&nbsp;3.
2. Although you may edit this file for readability and accessibility,
   you will be working in different files in this project: **do not
   put your assignment work in this file**. Put your work in the
   appropriate places otherwise your work might not be reviewed.
3. This file contains the instructions for Assignment&nbsp;2
   Part&nbsp;2.
4. Instructions for submitting Assignment&nbsp;2 Part&nbsp;2 are on
   the Assessment part of the website: this is so that there is a
   single, definitive set of instructions in case they need updating.
5. Assignment&nbsp;2 Part&nbsp;2 is summative (for marks).
6. It helps if you've done Tutorial&nbsp;3 so you are familiar with
   `markdown` and engineering requirements, both of which you need for
   Assignment&nbsp;2.
7. It really helps if you have done Tutorial&nbsp;5 so you have had
   chance to road test your work on other students.
8. If you are a non-native speaker of English do not spend too long
   understanding the instructions by translating: you need to learn to
   read longer texts quickly &mdash; 45&nbsp;minutes should be more
   than enough

## Assignment rules ##

1. **Follow the instructions:** not following the instructions is the
   number one criticism teachers tend to make of students &mdash;
   markers are permitted to penalise and even largely ignore
   submissions that have not followed the instructions.
2. **Work within the spirit of the rules** not just the exact wording.
3. Take pride in your work and check it properly before you submit it.
4. The deadline is on the Course Schedule page on the Inf1B Learn page
   &mdash; it is not repeated here because we want to have a single,
   definitive source for the deadline in case it needs to be changed.
5. Only post in
   [the official single thread on Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/lbkxl8hz9he5ae/post/108)
   for Assignment&nbsp;2 related queries: do not start other threads
   if you can avoid it.
6. You may use tools to help you draft any writing however the version
   you submit must be mostly your own effort and it must contain
   specific and exact examples for the challenge and your design(s),
   therefore the generic, non-specific output of AI-generated text is
   unsuitable for the final version.

## Engineering requirements for this part of the assignment ##

These requirements outline what is required, what is encouraged or
discouraged, and what is banned. These are neither exhaustive nor a
challenge to find loopholes. They are here to guide you. In
particular: remember the whole assignment is about being
beginner-friendly, so if you feel you need to ask whether something
advanced is allowed, the answer is **"please rethink your design to be
beginner-friendly."**

Your overall submission **MUST**:
1.  be primarily and demonstrably your own work;
2.  properly and specifically acknowledge the contributions of other
    people and tools;
3.  retain the project structure as it was given out;
4.  obey the project structure as it was given out;
5.  use the exact file names as directed by the instructions;
6.  be less than 5&nbsp;MB overall;
7.  use jpeg images, each of which is no more than 1&nbsp;MB in size
    but of sufficient resolution that the content is easily legible to
    someone with low vision;
8.  contain the identifying details specified in each `markdown` file;
9.  remove the instructions and guidelines as directed in the
    appropriate files;
10. directly include specific files from your Part&nbsp;1 submission
    as directed in the instructions;
11. be submitted as a `zip` file exported by IntelliJ.

Your overall submission **MUST NOT**:
1. include a `zip` file of a previous version of the project;
2. use image formats other than jpeg;
3. rename non-jpeg images to have a `.jpg` extension.

Your design **MUST**:
1. only use the Java concepts that have been taught in the first five
   weeks of this course whether in the lectures, reading, labs, or
   tutorials: so if you are an experienced programmer, think basic and
   imperative paradigm, preferably without method chaining &mdash; if
   none of that made any sense then you are well-placed for being
   beginner-friendly;
2. be predominantly and demonstrably your own work and effort;
3. acknowledge and reference other sources if they inspired or
   influenced your design, for example citing a particular answer on
   codegolf, or acknowledging the contribution(s) from friends,
   tutors, or lab demonstrators who helped you &mdash; getting help is
   good rather than bad but not acknowledging the help is at best rude
   and at worst cheating;
4. have the language level of the project set to an LTS version of
   Java, preferably&nbsp;11 or&nbsp;17 though 8 is acceptable.

Your design **MUST NOT**:
1. rely on third party libraries or software;
2. be plagiarised in part or as a whole;
3. use a version of Java earlier than version&nbsp;8;
4. use any programming language other than Java;
5. use regular expressions &mdash; if you don't know what these are
   you have nothing to worry about &mdash; unless a standard Java
   method requires a regular expression parameter, in which case you
   are limited to using simple regular expressions by **our**
   definition of "simple" not yours.

Your design **SHOULD**:
1. be suitable for beginners who have done the first five weeks of
   this course;
2. encourage beginners to want to code;
3. help beginners turn pseudocode into actual code;
4. have good accessibility credentials for people with dyslexia,
   colour-blindness, low vision;
5. attempt to have reasonable accessibility descriptions for images;
6. use only standard parts of the Java language;
7. use an LTS (Long Term Support) version of Java, preferably&nbsp;11
   or&nbsp;17 (8&nbsp;is acceptable but discouraged).

Your design **SHOULD NOT**:
1. require "a lot" of code to implement &mdash; this is a grey area
   but don't push your luck: a long solution to a codegolf challenge
   suggests an unsuitable design;
2. be super short, for example code-golfed &mdash; this is also a grey
   area but still don't push your luck: some of the golfed algorithms
   are suitable for beginners, others are scary, which is a judgement
   call but always err on the side of simplicity not terror;
3. use a version of Java earlier than version&nbsp;11 although 8 is
   acceptable.

Your design **MAY**:
1. use the Java collections on condition that:
   1. **you** are able to explain its use in **simple terms** to a
      (probably slightly confused) beginner &mdash; if you can't, you
      can't use that class;
   2. **you** are able to justify to us in detail why that particular
      class or data structure is used and how it works.

## Assignment instructions ##

Assignment&nbsp;2 is in two parts:

1. **Part&nbsp;1:** Consider the different challenges in the
   short-list, choose one, make and make a preliminary design.
2. **Part&nbsp;2:** Make use of your tutor's personalised feedback,
   the tutor group's general feedback, the cohort-level feedback;
   road-test on other students; refine your design; write a worksheet
   for beginners; reflect on what you have learnt during this
   assignment; and hand-in for marking.

The steps below have suggested time limits but you should not spend
excessive time on this part of the assignment to the detriment of
other assignments and subjects, or your well-being.

1. [**__maximum__ 2 hours**] Complete Tutorial&nbsp;5 (preferably at
   the tutorial session).
2. [**up to 2 hours**] Make use of the various sets of feedback.
3. [**up to 4 hours**] Update your design, description, and diagram
   working in the `02` versions of files, then put your best version
   into `worksheet.md`, following the instructions in that file.
4. [**up to 1 hour**] Complete `reflections.md`, following the
   instructions in that file &mdash; do not underestimate the
   importance of this step.
5. [**10 minutes for the remaining steps**] Save your work and export
   your project: `File > Export > Project to Zip File...`
6. Check your exported project `zip` file is structurally correct,
   complies with the file names and sizes, and that jpegs really are
   jpegs.
7. Check that the exported project `zip` does NOT contain any previous
   versions of the exported `zip` file.
8. Copy your exported project `zip` somewhere else, unpack it and
   check it again: the `zip` file should contain the version of your
   work you wish to submit.
9. Submit your project according to the instructions on the assignment
   website.

**It is your responsibility to check your submission is compliant with
the assignment's rules and requirements.** For non-compliant
submissions, we do not guarantee marking, partially or even at all.
