# Check if Words are Isomorphs #

### Main justifications ###

The challenge originally stuck out to me due to the word `"isomorph"` itself.
As a fan (AKA "nerd") of anagrams, word puzzles and language games (crosswords, word searches etc.),
I knew I had to choose the challenge.

At first glance of the challenge, I presumed the challenge to be:

- More challenging than the rest
- Requiring a complicated solution.

I chose it as I believe my Java skills to be __Intermediate__ to __Advanced__,
and I wanted to challenge myself by forcing myself to
convey a complicated concept to a beginner. I also wanted to share my
love and enjoyment for word puzzles with others.
Upon further thought, this challenge (like many of the
others I'm sure) can be simplified quite nicely for beginners, to form a single
elegant solution.

### Confidence ###

The task was clearly a well-thought-out.
Immediately, there were tell-tale signs that OP was of high quality:

- The description was clear and concise, including the expected inputs (`"INPUT: Take two non empty strings..."`) and
  outputs (`"OUTPUT: A consistent truthy value..."`)
- The examples / test cases provided were informative and included edge cases
- The immediate visual inspection of `"ESTATE"` and `"DUELED"` both
  having the letter scheme of `"abcda"` immediately explained what is expected from the
  challenge.

Simultaneously the challenge at hand was not a trivial one to solve.
I myself sat stumped for a while, unsure how I would solve it. This added
to my desire to do it as a challenge to myself, as well as the added
challenge of describing a complex solution to a beginner.
It was obviously challenging (and thus a good choice) because:

- There were many flavours of solutions, with a few getting disqualified for not solving all test cases.
  This implied that many people had sat and attempted the challenge, however only a selection solved the task.
- I myself sat there, (someone I like to think is) an experienced programmer and problem solver, stumped.

As well, it was clear there was room for creativity.
The OP received 47 possible solutions, each ranging from highly sophisticated
and compact to... less so. Due to the sheer number of potential solutions,
it's clear the challenge gives breadth for creativity. If there was no room for
creativity, a single solution would be submitted as the end-all-be-all.

For all of these reasons combined, I was highly confident in this chosen challenge.
