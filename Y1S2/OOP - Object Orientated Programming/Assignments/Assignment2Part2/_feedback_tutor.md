Feedback from tutor:

# First impression #

Followed some instructions but not all.

Looks like a thin effort.

Make more use of markdown, for example lists, bold, and headings.

# Acknowledgements #

Have not acknowledged Coblind color blindness simulator.

Not done.

If naming a person, say who they are (tutor, friend etc).

# Choice #

Justification convincing.

Confidence convincing.

# Design #

Diagram took about 30 seconds to understand.

Why is there no accessibility description?

The diagram might be hard to read for someone who's partially sighted.

Design not explained well.

Try linking the design to a relatable real-world concept.

Can you find a way to motivate a beginner to try this challenge other
than for the pure job of writing code.

## Description ##

Try to make the first sentence motivate the user to do this challenge, for example can you say why this is useful or interesting.

Before explaining the details of what is required, give an overview of the task. This needs to be general but not "big picture" such as "more and more in our daily lives" and definitely don't start with "nowadays" or a similar phrase.

Try using examples.

Instead of taking the beginner through the order of the code, try starting with the core line or lines of code and building outwards.

Try a list of steps instead of a paragraph of description.

# Overall #

There's work to do but it has promise.
