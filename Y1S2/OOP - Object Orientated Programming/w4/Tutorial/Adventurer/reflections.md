# Reflections on Working through this `IntelliJ` Project #

First edit the CSS `STYLE` at the bottom so the rendered output suits your 
needs.

Write a few words (up to one sentence) to summarise your contents and help
you identify this document quickly (like the `Subject:` line in an email)

Author: TODO insert your name

Date of tutorial: TODO insert date

Date of writing this document: TODO insert date

Headings are just for guidance: make the notes you need. Add, edit, ignore,
and delete as you wish.

## Generalisation ##

If you have only worked on a version that takes its input from the
command-line arguments, think about a version that takes its input from
StdIn (the keyboard or a file). If your version used StdIn think about the
command-line version. What advantages and disadvantages to each other are
there? Think about how you run the program but also think about how you can
test the program consistently, accurately, and quickly.

If you used a version that did not use an array think about a design that
does use an array. If you did use an array, think how could you redesign so
you don't need an array.

After you have finished designing or writing (or both) the program to print
dice faces, your boss says "We have a new deal with a company that makes
table-top games. Their dice have eight sides. Your design / program supports
this doesn't it?"

How few or how many changes would you have to make to your design or code to
enable this? The more changes, the less flexible your design. Don't beat
yourself up over this. What changes would you need to make? If you start again
with a different pathway, what you would differently from the start?

Where possible, especially with Assignments and multipart questions, look 
ahead to see what changes are needed later and try to design for those 
initially. This is not always feasible for a novice programmer because you 
can have too many design aspects, code choices, and IDE demands going on 
simultaneously. The more familiar you are with the IDE and the language, and 
the more experience you have in designing (rather than coding), the easier 
this should become. With experience comes the ability to identify where 
designs and code can be made more flexible or more robust.
