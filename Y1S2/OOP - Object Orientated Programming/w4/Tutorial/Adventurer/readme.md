# Self-study Instructions #

**Note:** These instructions are specific to this project.
First study the **general** instructions in the file `readme-general.md`

Check the `TODO` tab for further instructions.

Ensure the `Project` (`Alt+1`) and `Structure` (`Alt+7`) tabs are open.

This is the **Adventurer** pathway so you are going on a choose your own 
adventure.

To test any code use the instructions in `readme-general.md` to configure
`IntelliJ` either for command-line arguments or reading from a file.

Don't start by coding as that's usually the slowest and most error-prone
method. Instead have at least two designs on paper and think about the
relative merits of each design compared with the other designs. Try to make
your designs substantially different rather being minor variations of each
other.

Upload digital copies of your designs to the `design` directory but
optimise the image: a resolution large enough to be legible but a file size
small enough not to waste space. Imagine 400 other students will be doing
the same and we don't want to use half a gigabyte or more of storage. It
also slows the downloading process for the markers &mdash; tutorials aren't
marked but assignments are.
